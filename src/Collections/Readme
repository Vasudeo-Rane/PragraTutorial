1) Collection is there for storing the object, native datatype will not be supported.
2) We can enforce type safety of collections by using generic.
3) define the variable type as Object to handle different data type.


#Generics

Class<T>    --Type

define class with <T> , to make it generic and then the datatype need to be also generic T empId, R name.
